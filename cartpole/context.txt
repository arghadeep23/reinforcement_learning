This directory contains code for the CartPole problem. In this case, I have used both a neural network and reinforcement learning.

make sure to do :
pip install gymnasium[classic_control]
to install pygame as it does not come with gym library beforehand

note that, in this case, I have used gymnasium instead of gym, as that
library is deprecated, and gymnasium has all the latest updates.
